## Monsters and Heroes
Our simulation makes use of monster, hero and human agents which interact between each other to prosper. The objective of this scenario is to verify the agents that thrive (human+heroes or monsters) having in count initial scenarios, possible mutations, etc. 

### Interactions
* Monster-Human: For a monster to survive it must "eat" humans. This agent will have stronger attributes than the regular human.
* Hero-Human: The hero agent aims to keep humans alive.
* Hero-Monster: The hero agent will have stronger attributes than the monsters. If this agent is overwhelmed by monsters it dies.
* Human-World: For a human agent to survive it must find food to keep itself alive. This food can contain characteristics that can make the human agent mutate into a monster or hero.
